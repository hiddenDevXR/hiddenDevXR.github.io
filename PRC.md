## Story

In a sprawling metropolis of the future, the Pop Soda Corporation unveiled a groundbreaking series of flavors tailored explicitly for the discerning 'Droid' market. Despite the apparent limitation of taste buds in the robotic populace, initial trials deemed the new sodas an unparalleled success. However, these seemingly innocuous beverages triggered an unforeseen and chaotic reaction among the city's droids, setting off waves of pandemonium across the urban landscape.

As CITRUS, an enigmatic corporate operative shrouded in mystery and equipped with an electrifying arm, your clandestine mission unfolds: recover any remnants of the fizzy elixir still coursing within the droids' circuitry before the omnipresent government intervenes. Those relentless federal forces, ever watchful, threaten to complicate your covert agenda. Your directive is clearâ€”navigate the neon-lit cityscape, deftly neutralizing rogue droids with precision charges from your electrified appendage, all while securing crucial evidence of the soda's disruptive influence.

Time dwindles, each moment echoing the impending arrival of government forces. Can you restore order to the mechanized chaos before the powers-that-be intervene, or will the impending arrival of the authorities seal the fate of this futuristic city?

## Tech Report

This prototype was crafted as the culmination of my coursework in game development fundamentals during my master's degree. The primary goal was to design a 2D game incorporating a comprehensive array of technical implementations covered throughout the course. Some of the key elements integrated into this prototype include:

- Parallax Backgrounds: Implemented to create depth and dynamism within the game environment.
- 2D Movement Systems and Collisions: Leveraged for character movement and interaction within the game world.
- Camera System: Employed to manage the player's view and enhance gameplay experience.
- Object Pooling: Utilized for optimizing memory and enhancing performance.
- Animation Controllers: Integrated for character animations and in-game responsiveness.

This project served as a hands-on exploration of diverse technical aspects crucial to 2D game development. The aim was to showcase a synthesis of these elements while creating an engaging game experience.

Moreover, this game utilizes assets from the Synty Studio Cyberpunk package, originally designed for 3D environments. By adapting the 2D systems to function within a 3D space and utilizing an orthographic camera restricted to movement solely in the XY plane, the gameplay experience retains a 2D perspective within a 3D environment.

This project aims to showcase the adaptation of 2D mechanics within a 3D setting, blurring the lines between the traditional distinctions of 2D and 3D gaming experiences.

This repository contains the complete Unity project encompassing all necessary assets to run the game within the Unity editor. Please note that this is a prototype, serving as a demonstration of various technical implementations learned during my master's degree program.

While functional, many systems within the game are open to improvement and refinement. It's important to acknowledge that this project serves as a foundation for further development and enhancement.

My aspiration is to continuously improve this project until it evolves into a comprehensive, fully realized experience suitable for distribution, potentially even as a free offering on storefronts. Your feedback and contributions are welcomed and appreciated as I strive to transform this prototype into a polished, engaging game.
