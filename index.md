## TwinMotion

During my Master's program, I began exploring Twinmotion, discovering its versatility in architectural visualization and game design. As I delved into this tool, I found its potential for swiftly prototyping level designs and creating engaging renders. While still in the learning phase, Twinmotion became my playground for merging architectural concepts with game design elements, allowing me to craft immersive visuals and bring my ideas to life.

Here, in chronological order, are some of the projects I've worked on using Twinmotion.

## Computer Graphics

I'm challenging myself to delve into computer graphics programming to enhance my skills as a technical artist. Presently, I'm taking small but significant steps by utilizing OpenTK, a framework that facilitates working with OpenGL through C#. It's early days, but I'm committed to making steady progress and aiming for significant advancements in the coming months.

## HALO 4 review (2023)

As part of my Master's in Game Design course, we were tasked with reviewing a game of our choice. Recently, I've been diving back into HALO MCC, a title that initially received mixed reception upon its release but one that I've loved from day one.

> _My HALO 4 Review_
> 
> As a long-time fan of the Halo series, diving into Halo 4 was an experience filled with anticipation and excitement. Developed by 343 Industries, this installment marks a significant change in the saga, both in narrative depth and game dynamics.
> 
> One of the notable aspects is how 343 Industries attempted to infuse their own distinctive style into the franchise. For some fans, this departure from Bungie's path wasn't exactly what they expected, but it's commendable that 343 took the step to leave their mark on the series rather than strictly sticking to the stablished formula.
> 
> The most obvious change lies in the gameplay, which appears to have taken inspiration from popular contemporary shooters like Call of Duty. This adjustment could polarize fans, as it leans towards a more modernized style seen in other games. However, it is an understandable attempt to keep up with changing video game trends.
> 
> Introducing the Forerunners and the Didact into the narrative was a brilliant move. It adds layers of depth and mythology to the Halo universe, offering a new perspective and expanding the mythos. However, there is a flaw in the execution: the Didact's character development relies heavily on a trilogy of books, leaving some players disconnected from his in-game arc.
> 
> The direction of the art style in terms of graphics was controversial. Although it looks better visually, it was perceived as misguided, as it took two additional games for 343 Industries to return to the original design formula with Halo Infinite.
> 
> The narrative unfolds with the return of the Master Chief, immersing players in an immersive story that delves into the humanity of the enigmatic Spartan. The emotional depth added to the Master Chief's character brings a new dimension to the series, making the journey feel personal and captivating.
> 
> In terms of gameplay, Halo 4 successfully retains the essence of what makes the series great while introducing new elements. The combat mechanics feel refined, offering a balanced mix of familiar mechanics and fresh innovations. The addition of new weapons and enemy types keeps the game engaging and challenging.
> 
> Multiplayer, a cornerstone of the Halo franchise, receives an impressive revamp in Halo 4. The revamped multiplayer introduces innovative features, offering diverse maps, engaging game modes, and a robust customization system that encourages replayability and the competitive spirit.
> 
> The sound design deserves applause, complementing the visual grandeur with a rich and immersive audio experience. The iconic soundtrack, composed by Neil Davidge, adds emotional depth to the game, enhancing every moment of the journey. Change this part to mention that Neil Davidge replaces the legendary Martin O'Donell and that he manages to preserve distinctive melodic passages from the original soundtrack while also adding his own identity...
> 
> However, even though Halo 4 excels in many aspects, it encounters some pacing issues in its campaign, occasionally interrupting the immersive experience.
> 
> In conclusion, Halo 4 is a triumphant continuation of the beloved series. With its captivating narrative, stunning graphics, refined gameplay, and revamped multiplayer, it stands as a testament to the evolution of the Halo universe. Despite small flaws, such as the Didact's development that relies heavily on external lore, it is a must-have for long-time fans and newcomers alike, offering an unforgettable gaming experience.
